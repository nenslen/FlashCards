# Flash Cards
A flash card program that I made to help with studying in university.

## Features
This program allows the user to create folders (classes) and then add sets of flash cards. Cards (questions and answers) can then be added to flash card sets. Folders, card sets, and cards can be created, updated, and deleted as necessary.

## Use
After answering a question on a flash card, you can rate how well you did on that question on a scale from 1 - 5. This is used to show certain questions more or less frequently (questions you did well on are shown less frequently than questions you did poorly on). Finally, a percentage from 0 - 100 is given for each quiz to show how well you know that quiz. For example, if you rated each question as 4/5 for how well you did, then that quiz will have a score of 80%.

## My results
I found this program quite useful for studying certain classes that required memorization. The interface is fully functional but could use some work to make it more appealing.
